I dreamed about having a sidebar on the left which allows you to control the humidity, temperature and visibility. 
Additional mini features include: 
  + Updating current time and the sky will correspond to the time by clicking the button
  + Show the temperatures in celsuis and fahrenheit 
  + Place a house beside the road to see what happens to it if the weather changes
