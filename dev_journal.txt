I managed to change the background and the sun moving. I also got the clock working ( like ticking itself an hour for each 
passing second ) But the problem is the sun rises at 12:00 AM and sets at midnight.

+ So what I wanted to do is that I'm going to add a hyperbolic trajectory to the sun and fix its sunrise and sunset pattern. 
+ I'm going to make the sun rise at 6 AM and set at 6 PM ( in keyframes term they are 25% and 75% respectively)
+ The sky remains dark until 5 AM and I use another color for the dawn sky. 
+ I expect the sky to turn dark after 6 until 5 AM the next morning. 

Nothing has been done up to date :( 
But I'll keep trying
