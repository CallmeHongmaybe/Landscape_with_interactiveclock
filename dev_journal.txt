I managed to change the background and the sun moving. I also got the clock working ( like ticking itself an hour for each 
passing second ) But the problem is the sun rises at 12:00 AM and sets at midnight.

+ So what I wanted to do is that I'm going to add a hyperbolic trajectory to the sun and fix its sunrise and sunset pattern. 
+ I'm going to make the sun rise at 6 AM and set at 6 PM ( in keyframes term they are 25% and 75% respectively)
+ The sky remains dark until 5 AM and I use another color for the dawn sky. 
+ I expect the sky to turn dark after 6 until 5 AM the next morning. 

Nothing has been done up to date :( 
But I'll keep trying

I managed to do all of the requirements made yesterday. The sun rises at 6 and sets at 5. 
The next day I'll add moonrise and moonset. It is totally different from how the sun rises and sets so I need to make further research into its nature. 

To-do lists: 
  + Research the pattern of moonrise and moonset ( what time it rises and what time it sets ) 
  + Draw the path of the moon in 12 steps
  + Decorate the day with clouds and night skies with stars ( if possible )

I finished drawing the moon and its path. Felt happy and accomplished. But I only assume that the moon rises at 7 PM and sets at 5 AM. The clock doesn't have a reset function and I haven't decorated the sky yet. Better leave it for the next day. Even though the moon calculator was a helpful one but the moon's rising and setting pattern seemed indigestible to me :( . 

To Do lists: 
  + Decorate the day with clouds and night skies with stars 
  + Place a bench on the grassfield with a house (@@ if possible) coz drawing a house can take another week !!
  + Research an algorithm to make the moon fast forward its rising time by 1 hour each day.

I realized that decorating the sky can be harder than I would imagine. Even though I had a lot of problems drawing the stars. I got stressed out a bit and I had no idea where the error was so I took a break and who knew, I did it at 8 am. However, there are a lot of things that should've done today. 
To-do lists: 
+ Place a bench on the grassfield with a lamp (@@ if possible) coz drawing a house can take another week !!
+ Research an algorithm to make the moon fast forward its rising time by 1 hour each day. ( if possible )

Yes! I've finished the project at last! The website looks beautiful and stunning ( to me ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‡). But I saw the lack of algorith and the code saw little involvement from .js script. I won't be able to concentrate on the project as much as I did in the past but whenever I had time I tried to make the code look more interactive and users can adjust the weather or switch locations where the sun and the moon rises differently from my imaginary place. That'll require a lot of energy and time especially for a newbie like me. But I'll do my best ðŸ˜Œ.

Hi long time no see~~! The website code has now been moved to Brackets and the sidebar has been completed. Now I'm just gonna add something to the info board.
